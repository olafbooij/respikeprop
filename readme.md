# ReSpikeProp

An implementation of "A gradient descent rule for spiking neurons emitting multiple spikes", Olaf Booij, Hieu tat Nguyen, Information Processing Letters, Volume 95, Issue 6, 30 September 2005, Pages 552-558.

For now this is a very (very!) inefficient implementation of the SpikeProp
algorithm. However, the code is concise and easy to match with the formulas of
the paper and therefore has some educational value. Note that this
implementation was not(!) used for the experiments in the paper.


The name of this repository, ReSpikeProp, is to stress the fact that
spiking neurons can be connected in a recurrent manner, without any adjusment
to the backpropagation method.
